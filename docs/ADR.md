# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## ADR-001: Frontend Framework - React over Vue
**Decision**: Use React 18 with TypeScript for the frontend
**Rationale**: 
- Mature ecosystem with extensive banking/finance component libraries
- Better TypeScript integration and tooling
- Larger talent pool and community support
- Material-UI provides excellent accessibility features out of the box
**Alternatives Considered**: Vue 3, Angular
**Trade-offs**: Larger bundle size, but better long-term maintainability

## ADR-002: Backend Framework - Express.js over NestJS
**Decision**: Use Express.js with TypeScript for the backend
**Rationale**:
- Faster development velocity for MVP
- More flexible middleware ecosystem
- Lighter weight, better performance for API-focused service
- Easier to implement custom multi-agent orchestration
**Alternatives Considered**: NestJS, FastAPI, Spring Boot
**Trade-offs**: Less opinionated structure, but more control over architecture

## ADR-003: Database - PostgreSQL over SQLite
**Decision**: Use PostgreSQL with monthly partitioning
**Rationale**:
- Production-ready ACID compliance for financial data
- Excellent partitioning support for 1M+ transactions
- Advanced indexing capabilities for complex queries
- Built-in JSON support for flexible agent traces
**Alternatives Considered**: SQLite, MongoDB
**Trade-offs**: More complex setup, but essential for production scale

## ADR-004: Caching Strategy - Redis over In-Memory
**Decision**: Use Redis for rate limiting, sessions, and short-term caching
**Rationale**:
- Persistent across restarts for rate limiting
- Excellent for distributed rate limiting patterns
- Built-in TTL support for session management
- Industry standard for high-performance APIs
**Alternatives Considered**: In-memory cache, Memcached
**Trade-offs**: Additional infrastructure, but essential for production

## ADR-005: Real-time Updates - SSE over WebSockets
**Decision**: Use Server-Sent Events for agent progress streaming
**Rationale**:
- Simpler implementation for one-way communication
- Automatic reconnection handling
- Better HTTP/2 multiplexing support
- Sufficient for agent progress updates
**Alternatives Considered**: WebSockets, Polling
**Trade-offs**: One-way only, but simpler and more reliable

## ADR-006: State Management - React Query + Zustand over Redux
**Decision**: Use React Query for server state, Zustand for client state
**Rationale**:
- React Query handles caching, synchronization, and background updates
- Zustand provides simple, unopinionated client state management
- Less boilerplate than Redux Toolkit
- Better TypeScript integration
**Alternatives Considered**: Redux Toolkit, SWR, Apollo Client
**Trade-offs**: Multiple state solutions, but each optimized for its use case

## ADR-007: UI Components - Material-UI over Custom
**Decision**: Use Material-UI (MUI) component library
**Rationale**:
- Built-in accessibility features (WCAG compliance)
- Comprehensive component set for banking interfaces
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Virtualization support for large lists
**Alternatives Considered**: Ant Design, Chakra UI, Custom components
**Trade-offs**: Bundle size, but significant development time savings

## ADR-008: Database Partitioning - Monthly over Customer Hash
**Decision**: Partition transactions table by month
**Rationale**:
- Aligns with typical banking query patterns (90-day windows)
- Easier to manage data retention policies
- Better performance for time-series queries
- Simpler maintenance and backup strategies
**Alternatives Considered**: Customer hash partitioning, No partitioning
**Trade-offs**: Less even distribution, but better query performance

## ADR-009: Authentication - API Key over JWT
**Decision**: Use API key authentication with role-based access
**Rationale**:
- Simpler for internal tool usage
- Better for service-to-service communication
- Easier to implement rate limiting per key
- No token expiration complexity
**Alternatives Considered**: JWT, OAuth2, Session-based
**Trade-offs**: Less secure than JWT, but appropriate for internal tools

## ADR-010: Multi-Agent Architecture - Custom Orchestrator over LangChain
**Decision**: Build custom multi-agent orchestrator
**Rationale**:
- Full control over agent interactions and guardrails
- Deterministic fallbacks without external dependencies
- Custom tool calling with schema validation
- Optimized for banking-specific workflows
**Alternatives Considered**: LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI
**Trade-offs**: More development time, but better control and performance

## ADR-011: Observability - Winston + Prometheus over ELK
**Decision**: Use Winston for logging, Prometheus for metrics
**Rationale**:
- Simpler setup for MVP and local development
- Winston provides excellent JSON logging with PII redaction
- Prometheus metrics integrate well with React Query
- Sufficient for production monitoring
**Alternatives Considered**: ELK Stack, DataDog, New Relic
**Trade-offs**: Less advanced features, but simpler and more cost-effective

## ADR-012: Deployment - Docker Compose over Kubernetes
**Decision**: Use Docker Compose for local development and deployment
**Rationale**:
- Simpler setup for development and testing
- Easier to run locally with all dependencies
- Sufficient for MVP and small-scale production
- Faster iteration and debugging
**Alternatives Considered**: Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Serverless
**Trade-offs**: Less scalable, but much simpler for initial deployment
